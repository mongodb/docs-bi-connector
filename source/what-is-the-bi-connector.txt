====================================
What is the MongoDB Connector for BI
====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. include:: /includes/fact-bi-enterprise.rst

Traditional business intelligence tools work with flat, tabular data.
These tools aren't sophisticated enough to understand three-dimensional
data stored in MongoDB databases.

The MongoDB Connector for Business Intelligence (BI) allows you to
create queries with |sql| to visualize, graph, and report on your
three-dimensional MongoDB data using relational 
business intelligence tools such as :doc:`Tableau </connect/tableau>`
and :doc:`Power BI </connect/powerbi>`.

.. note::

   As an alternative to using third-party data visualization tools and
   the |bi-short|, you can use :charts:`MongoDB Charts </>` to create
   data visualizations directly from your MongoDB collections.

The |bi| acts as a layer that translates queries and data between a
|mongod| or |mongos| instance and your reporting tool. The |bi-short|
stores no data, and purely serves to bridge your MongoDB cluster with
business intelligence tools.

System Components
-----------------

A complete BI system includes the following components:

MongoDB database
  Data storage.

BI Connector
  Provides a relational schema and translates |sql|
  queries between your BI tool and MongoDB.

|jdbc| and |odbc| drivers
  Provides a standard method to connect to the |bi-short| and MongoDB
  databases from a BI Tool. Depending on what your BI Tool supports, you
  can use |jdbc| and |odbc| drivers to connect to the |bi-short|.

BI Tool
  Retrieve, visualize, and report on data from a database.

Your BI Tool and Driver typically run on your local machine. Your
database and your |bi-short| instance can run on your local machine,
in a data center, or hosted in the cloud.

The following sections describe possible configurations for a
BI system.

Hosted Database and |bi-short|
------------------------------

.. note::

   If you don't want to install and manage the |bi-short|, you can use
   {+atlas+}, our fully-managed database-as-a-service. Databases hosted
   on {+atlas+} natively support the |bi| and make it easy to start
   analyzing your data with your preferred BI tools. To get started,
   :website:`create an {+atlas+} cluster </cloud/atlas/lp/general>`.

In this scenario, the database and |bi-short| applications both run on
{+atlas+}, and you set up your :doc:`DSN </tutorial/create-system-dsn>`
with connection information that {+atlas+} provides.

Hosted Database and On Premises |bi-short|
------------------------------------------

If you have an {+atlas+} deployment smaller than M10 (including the
{+atlas+} :atlas:`free tier </getting-started/>`), or if your MongoDB
instance is not hosted on {+atlas+}, you can run |bi-short| locally and
specify a remote database address with the
:option:`--mongo-uri <mongosqld --mongo-uri>` option when you start
the BI Connector's :doc:`mongosqld process </reference/mongosqld>`.

On Premises Database and |bi-short|
-----------------------------------

Your organization may have installations of both MongoDB and |bi-short|
elsewhere on your network, in which case you can set up your
:doc:`DSN </tutorial/create-system-dsn>` to point to the |bi-short|
server address.

Local Database and |bi-short|
-----------------------------

For testing and all-in-one-box local experimentation, you can run
MongoDB and |bi-short| on your desktop. This is the simplest
configuration, perfect for quickly looking over the possibilities for
data visualization with |bi-short|.

Learn more about setting up a local |bi-short| test installation
in the :doc:`Quick Start Guide </local-quickstart>`.
