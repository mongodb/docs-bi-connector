What is the MongoDB Connector for BI?

Traditional business intelligence tools work with flat, tabular data.
These tools aren't sophisticated enough to understand three-dimensional
data stored in MongoDB databases.

The MongoDB Connector for Business Intelligence (BI) allows you to
create queries with |sql| to visualize, graph, and report on your
three-dimensional MongoDB data using relational 
business intelligence tools such as :doc:`Tableau </connect/tableau>`
and :doc:`Power BI </connect/powerbi>`.

.. note::

   As an alternative to using third-party data visualization tools and
   the |bi-short|, you can use :charts:`MongoDB Charts </>` to create
   data visualizations directly from your MongoDB collections.

The |bi| acts as a layer that translates queries and data between a
|mongod| or |mongos| instance and your reporting tool. The |bi-short|
stores no data, and purely serves to bridge your MongoDB cluster with
business intelligence tools.

System Components
-----------------

A complete BI system includes the following components:

BI tool
  Retrieve, visualize, and report on data from a database.

|jdbc| or |odbc| driver
  Provides a standard method to connect to the |bi-short| and MongoDB
  databases from a BI Tool. Depending on what your BI Tool supports, you
  can use |jdbc| or |odbc| drivers to connect to the |bi-short|.

BI Connector
  Provides a relational schema and translates |sql|
  queries between your BI tool and MongoDB.

MongoDB database
  Data storage.

   :alt: Diagram showing that other BI tools communicate with the DSN, which communicates with MongoDB's BI Connector, which in turn communicates with the MongoDB database.

Your **BI tool** and **driver** typically run on your local machine. 
Your **{+bi-short+} instance** and your **database** can run on your 
local machine, in a data center, or hosted in the cloud.

|bi-short| Configurations
-------------------------

The following table outlines the supported configurations for the 
|bi-short| and MongoDB database deployments:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 40 30 30

   * - |bi-short| configuration
     - {+atlas-short+} database (hosted)
     - On-premises database
  
   * - {+atlas-short+} |bi-short| (hosted)
     - :icon:`check`

       *Clusters M10 and greater only*
     -

   * - On-premises |bi-short|
     - :icon:`check`
     - :icon:`check`

The following sections describe these configurations:

Hosted Database and |bi-short|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this configuration, your database and |bi-short| 
applications both run on {+atlas+}, MongoDB's fully-managed 
database-as-a-service. Databases hosted on {+atlas+} natively support 
the |bi-short|.

.. note::

   You must have an M10 or higher {+atlas+} cluster to enable the 
   built-in |bi-short|.

:ref:`Enable the BI Connector <enable-bi-atlas>` for {+atlas+}, then 
use the connection information that {+atlas-short+} provides to 
configure your |jdbc| or |odbc| driver.

Hosted Database and On-Premises |bi-short|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this configuration, your MongoDB database runs on any 
internet-accessible host, including any tier of {+atlas+} cluster, and 
your |bi-short| runs locally.

:ref:`Install <installation-guides>` and :ref:`launch <launch>` the 
|bi-short|, specifying a remote database address, then configure your 
|jdbc| or |odbc| driver to connect to the |bi-short|.

On-Premises Database and |bi-short|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this configuration, the database and |bi-short| applications both 
run on-premises, either locally or on your network. 

:ref:`Install <installation-guides>` and :ref:`launch <launch>` the 
|bi-short|, then configure your |jdbc| or |odbc| driver to connect to 
the |bi-short| server address.

Local Database and |bi-short|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For testing and all-in-one-box local experimentation, you can run
MongoDB and the |bi-short| on your desktop. This configuration might be 
helpful for proofs of concept or as a way to explore the possibilities 
of data visualization with the |bi-short|.

Learn more about setting up a local |bi-short| test installation
in the :doc:`Quick Start Guide </local-quickstart>`.
