.. !!!!! NOTE TO FOLKS UPDATING THIS !!!!!
.. The BI Connector team derives
.. the links to the release notes based on the assumption that we'll
.. use the following heading format: |bi| x.x.x

.. When you add notes for a new release, you **must** use that
.. formatting for the H3 so that the rendered target is the format they
.. expect and we don't break the links on the downloads page.

.. _bi-2-11-1:

|bi| 2.11.1
-----------

*Released July 8, 2019*

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

Fixes a bug that caused the MySQL schema to include incorrect foreign
key constraints.

Fixes a bug that caused incorrect pushdown for some very large or very
small ``date`` and ``datetime`` values.

Fixes a bug that caused aliases to be ignored for tables in the
``information_schema`` database.

.. _bi-2-11-0:

|bi| 2.11.0
-----------

*Released May 16, 2019*

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adds a number of optimizations that are applied to generated
  aggregation pipelines before sending them to MongoDB.

- Adds new subcommands to :binary:`~bin.mongodrdl` for storing a
  ``DRDL`` file in MongoDB and for manipulating stored schemas.

- Enables :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` to use stored ``DRDL`` schemas instead
  of sampling. To learn more, see :ref:`2.11-schema-management-changes`.

- Introduces the beta version of :binary:`~bin.mongotranslate`, a
  command-line utility that can translate SQL queries to
  aggregation pipelines without a running |bi-short| or MongoDB
  instance.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixes a problem that caused the |bi-short| to generate unnecessarily
  long ``$group`` key names.

- Fixes a bug that caused the |bi-short| to generate incorrect table
  pipelines in
  :ref:`polymorphic schema mapping mode <system-environment-variables>`.

- Fixes a bug that caused the |bi-short| to panic when printing some
  query plans.

- Fixes a bug where the |bi-short|’s in-memory evaluation of
  string-to-date conversions did not match the pushdown behavior.

- Updates the supported Amazon Linux version to match the version
  supported by MongoDB 4.2.

- Fixes a bug with Active Directory constrained delegation in the
  |bi-short|’s GSSAPI implementation (linux and macOS).

- Introduces a ``--gssapiConstrainedDelegation`` flag that must be enabled
  to ensure existing Kerberos configurations are not broken.

- Fixes a bug that caused Kerberos authentication to fail with a linux
  :binary:`~bin.mongosqld`, MongoDB 4.0, and an Active Directory KDC.

- Fixes a number of small bugs related to correlated subqueries.

Chages/Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changes some schema-management configuration options.

- Deprecates schema-modification support via ``ALTER TABLE``, as well as
  the ``enable_table_alterations`` :ref:`system variable <system-environment-variables>` and
  :manual:`setParameter </reference/configuration-options/#setparameter-option/>`  

.. _bi-2-10-0:

|bi| 2.10.0
-----------

*Released Mar 15, 2019*

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixes a bug where aggregate functions returned ``NULL`` in dual
  queries with the ``DUAL`` keyword omitted.

- Fixes a bug where some invalid ``DUAL`` queries did not return an
  error.

- Fixes a bug that prevented pushdown of some joins to derived tables
  selecting from ``DUAL``.

- Fixes some correctness bugs in the in-memory evaluation for 
  :doc:`mysql-mode conversions </reference/type-conversion/>`.

- Fixes a bug where some trig functions (``ascii``, ``acos``, and
  ``asin``) could return incorrect results due to missing
  :ref:`type conversions <type-conversion-modes>`.

- Fixes a bug where some subquery comparisons could return incorrect
  results due to missing
  :ref:`type conversions <type-conversion-modes>`.

- Fixes a bug where we lost precision while converting a ``Uint64`` to a
  ``Decimal``.

- Fixes a correctness bug with the ``INSERT`` scalar function's pushdown
  translation.

- Fixes a bug where unstable sorting caused non-deterministic renaming
  of colliding collection/field names during schema mapping.

- Fixes a bug where some valid subquery comparisons returned errors.

- Fixes a bug where some valid subquery and tuple comparisons returned
  errors.

- Fixes a bug where queries using ``xor`` returned errors on MongoDB 3.2
  because the generated pipelines required features added in MongoDB
  3.4.

- Fixes a bug that caused kerberos
  :ref:`authentication <client-authentication>` to fail with MongoDB
  4.0.

Date and Time Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release resolves a number of inconsistencies in the |bi-short|'s
date and timestamp semantics. Resolving these inconsistencies resulted
in some changes to user-facing behavior:

- Removes inconsistent support for partial dates.

  - MySQL can represent partial dates that are
    `missing month or day components <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/date-and-time-functions.html>`__.
    It is impossible to represent these incomplete dates with
    MongoDB dates. Attempting to correctly manipulate and render
    incomplete dates was causing a number of bugs and inconsistencies
    with complete dates.

  - Starting with version 2.10, the |bi-short| does not support
    operations on or expressions that return incomplete dates.
    Going forward, we cannot provide guarantees about the behavior of
    operations that attempt to construct incomplete dates.

- Updates the ``DATE(a)`` and ``TIMESTAMP(a)`` scalar functions to be
  equivalent to ``CAST(a AS DATE)``, and ``CAST(a AS DATETIME)``,
  respectively.

  - The behavior of the ``DATE`` and ``TIMESTAMP`` scalar functions will
    depend on the value of the ``type_conversion_mode`` variable. This
    will change the default behavior for those scalar functions.

  - Queries affected by this change can be rewritten to use a more
    explicit conversion function (such as ``str_to_date``) that does not
    depend on ``type_conversion_mode``. If an affected query cannot be
    rewritten, a user may set ``type_conversion_mode`` variable to
    ``mysql``, which instructs the BI Connector to perform all type
    conversions with MySQL semantics instead of MongoDB semantics.

    .. important::

       This is discouraged unless absolutely necessary, as it
       significantly curtails the ability to push down type conversions
       across the board.

  - For more information on type conversions and the
    ``type_conversion_mode`` system variable, see
    :ref:`Type Conversion Modes <type-conversion-modes>`.
